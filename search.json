Quienes investigan con datos de la ECH deben compatibilizar variables —es decir, mapear las distintas convenciones de nombres un esquema común— antes de que cualquier análisis inter-anual sea posible. La compatibilización de la ECH ha sido un trabajo histórico del Instituto de Economía (IECON) de la Universidad de la República. El dataset resultante tiene DOI: http://doi.org/10.47426/ECH.INE (Instituto de Economía, 2020). metasurvey busca complementar y facilitar este tipo de trabajo ofreciendo herramientas reproducibles en R. En la academia uruguaya, este trabajo se ha realizado en STATA durante más de 30 años. Un pipeline de compatibilización típico consiste en aproximadamente 8 archivos .por año, cubriendo: 2_correc_datos.– Carga de datos crudos, unión de archivos de personas y hogares, corrección de nombres de variables 3_compatibilizacion_mod_1_4.– Armonización de módulos demográficos, de salud, educación y trabajo 4_ingreso_ht11.– Construcción del ingreso del hogar (ht11) 5_descomp_fuentes.– Descomposición del ingreso por fuente 6_ingreso_ht11_sss.– Ajustes de seguridad social 7_check_ingr.– Validación de variables de ingreso 8_arregla_base_comp.– Preparación final del dataset 9_labels.– Aplicación de etiquetas de valores Multiplicado por más de 30 años, eso significa más de 240 scripts de STATA haciendo esencialmente la misma tarea: mapear variables crudas de la ECH un esquema común. metasurvey resuelve esto con recipes.
