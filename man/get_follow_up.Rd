\title{Get follow-up surveys from a rotating panel}
\usage{
get_follow_up(
  RotativePanelSurvey,
  index = seq_along(RotativePanelSurvey$follow_up)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{RotativePanelSurvey}{A \code{RotativePanelSurvey} object from which
to extract the follow-up surveys}

\item{index}{Integer vector specifying which follow-up surveys to extract.
Defaults to all available (1:length(follow_up)). Can be a single index
or a vector of indices}
}
\value{
A list of \code{Survey} objects corresponding to the specified
follow-up surveys. If a single index is specified, returns a list with
one element
}
\description{
Extracts one or more follow-up surveys (waves after the implantation) from
a RotativePanelSurvey object. Follow-up surveys represent subsequent data
collections and are essential for longitudinal and temporal change analysis.
}
\details{
Follow-up surveys are fundamental in rotating panels because:
\itemize{
\item Enable longitudinal analysis: Track the same units over time
\item Capture temporal changes: Evolution of economic, social, and
demographic variables
\item Maintain representativeness: Each wave preserves population
representativeness through controlled rotation
\item Optimize resources: Reuse information from previous waves to
reduce collection costs
\item Facilitate comparisons: Consistent temporal structure for
trend analysis
}

In rotating panels like ECH:
\itemize{
\item Each follow-up wave covers a specific period (monthly/quarterly)
\item Units rotate gradually maintaining temporal overlap
\item Indices correspond to the chronological collection order
\item Each follow-up maintains methodological consistency with implantation
}
}

# Load rotating panel
panel_ech <- load_panel_survey(
  path = "ech_panel_2023.dta",
  svy_type = "ech_panel",
  svy_edition = "2023"
)

# Get first follow-up survey
followup_1 <- get_follow_up(panel_ech, index = 1)[[1]]

# Get multiple follow-ups
followups_q1 <- get_follow_up(panel_ech, index = c(1, 2, 3))

# Get all available follow-ups
all_followups <- get_follow_up(panel_ech)

# Check number of available follow-ups
n_followups <- length(get_follow_up(panel_ech))
cat("Available follow-ups:", n_followups)

# Longitudinal analysis with follow-ups
baseline <- get_implantation(panel_ech)
final_followup <- get_follow_up(panel_ech, index = n_followups)[[1]]

# Compare rates between implantation and final follow-up
initial_rate <- workflow(
  survey = baseline,
  svymean(~unemployment_rate, na.rm = TRUE)
)

final_rate <- workflow(
  survey = final_followup,
  svymean(~unemployment_rate, na.rm = TRUE)
)
}
