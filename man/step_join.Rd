\title{Join external data into survey (step)}
\usage{
step_join(
  svy = survey_empty(),
  x,
  by = NULL,
  type = c("left", "inner", "right", "full"),
  suffixes = c("", ".y"),
  use_copy = use_copy_default(),
  comment = "Join step",
  lazy = lazy_default(),
  record = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{svy}{A Survey or RotativePanelSurvey object. If NULL, returns a step call}

\item{x}{A data.frame/data.table or a Survey to join into \code{svy}}

\item{by}{Character vector of join keys. Named vector for different names
between \code{svy} and \code{x} (names are keys in \code{svy}, values are keys in \code{x}).
If NULL, tries to infer common column names}

\item{type}{Join type: "left" (default), "inner", "right", or "full"}

\item{suffixes}{Length-2 character vector of suffixes for conflicting columns
from \code{svy} and \code{x} respectively. Defaults to c("", ".y")}

\item{use_copy}{Whether to operate on a copy (default: use_copy_default())}

\item{comment}{Optional description for the step}

\item{lazy}{Logical, whether to delay execution.}

\item{record}{Logical, whether to record the step.}
}
\value{
Modified survey object with the join recorded as a step (and applied
immediately when baked). For RotativePanelSurvey, the join is applied to
implantation and every follow_up survey.
}
\description{
Creates a step that joins additional data into a Survey or RotativePanelSurvey.
Works with a data.frame/data.table or another Survey as the right-hand side.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Supports left, inner, right, and full joins
\item Allows named \code{by} mapping (e.g., c("id" = "code")) or simple vector
\item Avoids extra dependencies; resolves name conflicts by suffixing RHS columns
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# With data.frame
s <- Survey$new(
  data = data.table::data.table(id = 1:3, w = 1, a = c("x", "y", "z")),
  edition = "2023", type = "ech", psu = NULL, engine = "data.table",
  weight = add_weight(annual = "w")

info <- data.frame(id = c(1, 2), b = c(10, 20))
s2 <- step_join(s, info, by = "id", type = "left")
s2 <- bake_steps(s2)

# With another Survey
s_right <- Survey$new(
  data = data.table::data.table(id = c(2, 3), b = c(200, 300), w2 = 1),
  edition = "2023", type = "ech", psu = NULL, engine = "data.table",
  weight = add_weight(annual = "w2")
)
s3 <- step_join(s, s_right, by = c("id" = "id"), type = "inner")
s3 <- bake_steps(s3)
