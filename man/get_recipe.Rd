\description{
This function retrieves data transformation recipes from the metasurvey
repository or API, based on specific criteria such as survey type, edition,
and topic. It is the primary way to access predefined and community-validated
recipes.
}
\details{
This function is essential for:
\itemize{
\item Accessing official recipes: Get validated and maintained recipes
by specialized teams
\item Reproducibility: Ensure different users apply the same standard
transformations
\item Automation: Integrate recipes into automatic pipelines
\item Collaboration: Share methodologies between teams and organizations
\item Versioning: Access different recipe versions according to edition
}

The function first searches in local repositories and then queries the API
if necessary. Recipes are cached to improve performance.

Search criteria are combined with AND operator, so all specified criteria
must match for a recipe to be returned.
